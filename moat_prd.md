# Simplified Economic Moat Assessment

## Core Functionality
1. **Stock Ticker Input**
   - User provides a valid stock ticker symbol
   - System validates ticker existence before processing

2. **LLM Analysis**
   - Pass company name and basic financial data to LLM
   - Analyze against five pillars:
     - Brand power
     - Network effects
     - Cost advantages
     - Efficient scale/barriers to entry
     - Intangible assets

3. **Results**
   - Overall moat strength (Weak/Moderate/Strong)
   - Brief explanation for each pillar
   - Key strengths/weaknesses

## Technical Implementation
<!-- 1. **Data Collection**
   - Company name and basic financials from Alpha Vantage/Mock Provider (commented out, do not need for now) --> 

2. **LLM Prompt**
   - Template:
     ```
     Analyze {company}'s economic moat based on:
     - Brand power
     - Network effects
     - Cost advantages
     - Efficient scale/barriers
     - Intangible assets
     Provide overall strength and brief analysis for each pillar and give me an overall score and a confidence score. Return in the following JSON format:  
     {
        "data": {
            "company": "Company Name",
            "moat_strength": "Weak/Moderate/Strong",
            "moat_score": 1-10,
            "confidence_score": 1-10,
            "moat_analysis": {

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Stock Ticker Input**
   - User provides a valid stock ticker symbol
   - System validates ticker existence before processing

2. **Economic Moat Analysis**
   - LLM analyzes company data against the five pillars:
     - Brand power
     - Network effects
     - Cost advantages
     - Efficient scale/barriers to entry
     - Intangible assets

3. **Scoring System**
   - Generate overall moat strength score on a scale of 1-10
   - 1-3: Weak/no moat
   - 4-6: Moderate moat
   - 7-10: Strong moat
   - Include sub-scores for each pillar (1-10)

4. **Results Display**
   - Clear visualization of overall score
   - Breakdown of scores by pillar
   - Concise explanation of reasoning (250-500 words)
   - Key strengths and weaknesses highlighted

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Logic

   - Input: Company name
   - Output: JSON response with moat analysis
   - Error handling for LLM failures

     Analyze {company}'s economic moat based on:
     - Brand power
     - Network effects
     - Cost advantages
     - Efficient scale/barriers

     - Explanation for each pillar
     - Data sources
     ```

3. **Response Processing**

   - Extract and format results
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., unknown companies)


3. **API Endpoint**
   - GET /moat-analysis/{ticker}
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "company": "Company Name",
       "moat_strength": "Weak/Moderate/Strong",
       "moat_score": 1-10,

         "network_effects": "...",
         "cost_advantages": "...",
         "efficient_scale": "...",
         "intangible_assets": "..."
       },
       "data_sources": {
         "company_name": "...",
         "financial_data": "...",
         "moat_analysis": "..."

     }
     ```

### Frontend Implementation (ignore for now)
- Clean, intuitive interface for displaying moat assessment results
- Interactive elements to explore different moat pillars
- Visualization components for score representation
- Export and sharing capabilities

## Data Requirements (ignore for now)
- Company profile information
- Industry category and competitors
- Financial statements (last 5 years)
- Market share data
- Patent and intellectual property information
- Brand value rankings
- Consumer sentiment data
- Regulatory environment information

## User Experience
1. User enters stock ticker
2. System processes request through backend pipeline
3. Results displayed with summary and detailed breakdowns
4. Option to save or share analysis

## Performance Requirements
- Analysis generation complete within 5-10 seconds
- Results cached for 24 hours
- System handles batch processing for portfolio-wide analysis

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with moat analysis feature
- Accuracy of assessments (periodic audit)
- Correlation between high moat scores and long-term stock performance
- Feature usage retention over time

## Development Phases
### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic ticker input and validation
- Initial LLM implementation with five pillars framework
- Simple scoring and text explanation
- Basic frontend display (ignore for now)

<!-- Do not care about Phase 2 and Phase 3 for now -->
<!-- ### Phase 2
- Enhanced data sources
- Improved backend processing pipeline
- Additional metrics for more comprehensive analysis
- More detailed explanations

### Phase 3
- Industry-specific analysis parameters
- Historical trend analysis
- Integration with portfolio management tools
- Customizable alerts for moat strength changes -->

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: LLM generates inaccurate assessments
  **Mitigation**: Regular validation against expert analyses, continuous prompt refinement

- **Risk**: Data limitations for smaller companies
  **Mitigation**: Clear confidence indicators, alternative metrics for emerging businesses

- **Risk**: Processing time too long for user expectations
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching, background processing, and progress indicators

## Dependencies
- Access to financial databases (use Mock Provider for now)
- High-quality LLM with finance domain knowledge (use local ollama with deepseek)
- Development resources for backend implementation
